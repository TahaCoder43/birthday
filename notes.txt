there is a lot of stuff left to do 

one of the major things of this program is the AI

first of all you have to make the shooting bots more complex

they should be able to tell where you willl move and shooot the fireball at that position

you have to add the dificiulties so with each dificiulty the enemies would get more smarter

first of all the shootere should have propertuy called changer to true or false

based on the players pass movements it would calcullate if the player constantly changes directions

or if the player moves in one directions

the second property is shouldl have in very hard is the fireball could change the direction one time

in air while it's coming towards the player

this property should be smart in impossible, the shooter should have a property called will_decieve

based on pass movement it would calculate of the player would decieve the fireball changing direction

since the fireball will move in one direction and suddenlay changge the player can decieve it so the 

fireball should have a property where it would tell if the player is good enough that it decieves the 

fireball thus it will move in the opposite direciton in which the player moved, the player may notice 

it and stop decieving the shooter should also be able to note if the player stopped using the strategy


Teamwork:

In impossible enemies should have a property where they act as a team, this property should include 
shielders and attackers and connoring, basically some of then enemies would gather around to act as shield
and they shouldn't let the player move in oen spot they would only let the player move in one stop as
the attackers kept pushing the player and the sheilders keep blocking the players path, slowly like this 
the enemies should push the player to a corner and gaher there and attack the player at the same time
dealing the most amount of damage to the player, then fireballs should act in cornation, if one fireball is 
thrown in one direction the other one should be thrown in the other direction
